These giant online shops have with time been able to add to their sales the ability to sell fresh food and other home products through the internet.


The purpose of Online Grocery Ordering System is to make purchasing easier for the customers By ordering it on smartphones or Laptops via Online, Most importantly it reduces the inconvenience of Grocery selection by Eliminating trips to actual Grocery stores. So this theoretically helps Customers to shop easily at home much more quickly and easily staying at the same place rather than walking up to every section to select particular items.


Online ordering system results in an error free, secure, reliable and quick management system. It will facilitate shop managers in better utilization of resources. The project describes the way to manage for good performance and better accuracy and to provide Customer Satisfaction.
